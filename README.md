# Dataton-BC
The last notebook of the Dataton BC 2020 competition. A full data analysis project in 3 weeks.

Also a great example of how parallel computing is a MUST at this point.

Disclaimer: the code might be a little bit fuzzy and since the data is case sensitive I couldn't upload the spreadsheets to read.
